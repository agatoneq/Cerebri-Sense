# üß† CerebriSense ‚Äì Schizophrenia Support System Based on EEG Data

CerebriSense is a medical web application that supports psychiatrists in analyzing EEG signals to assist in diagnosing schizophrenia.  
It offers a clean interface, patient database, file uploads, and explainable AI output ‚Äî all tailored for clinical use.

‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: Due to an ongoing scientific publication, the deep learning model and related backend code are not included in this repository.*

## üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Key Features

- Secure registration and login for medical professionals
- Patient management: add, edit, view medical data
- EEG file upload in `.csv` format
- AI-based classification of EEG signals *(code hidden)*
- Report generation with visualizations (bar charts, predictions, SHAP insights)
- Temporary file analysis (outside database)
- Explainable AI using SHAP to visualize key feature impact
- Access to EEG exam protocols and technical requirements

## üíª Technologies

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, JavaScript, CSS
- **Backend:** Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Model (not included):** TensorFlow, Keras, SHAP, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- **Tools:** GitHub, Postman, pgAdmin, Google Colab

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `frontend/` ‚Äì user interface (React)
- `backend/` ‚Äì API and app logic (Flask) *(without model endpoints)*
- `docs/` ‚Äì development documentation and system diagrams
- `database/` ‚Äì PostgreSQL schema (users, patients, EEG files, analysis results)

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Local Setup (Without Model)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agatoneq/CerebriSense.git
cd CerebriSense

# Backend setup
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py

# Frontend setup
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the app at `http://localhost:3000`

> Note: EEG analysis will not function until the model is added.

## üß† How It Works (When Model Is Present)

1. Doctor uploads EEG `.csv` file
2. System processes file into ERP format
3. Deep learning model classifies patient (healthy/schizophrenic)
4. SHAP explains prediction with key feature contributions
5. Report is generated and stored in PostgreSQL

*(Steps 2‚Äì5 are excluded in this version)*
